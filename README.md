# Clarity Hackathon Level 0 2020

## Minting Non Fungible Digital Collectibles

This contract is a building block in enabling a saas based digital collectible platform in the
Blockstack eco-system for d-apps like loopbomb and radicle art. The contract defines a
project space which will become spaces of art / collectible rojects. The idea is analogous to / inspired by the
Open Sea Ethereum project.

The main goals in the current context are;

* getting to grips with clarity and stacks
* thinking about the core data structures needed for building a SaaS project on the stacks blockchain.

## Testing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:radicleart/clarity-hackathon-level0.git

npm install

npm run projects
```
