# Clarity Hackathon Level 0 2020

## Minting Non Fungible Digital Collectibles

This contract is a building block in enabling a saas based digital collectible platform in the
Blockstack eco-system. It is analogous to and inspired by the Open Sea platform and aspires to
bring a full blown marketplace for digital collectible projects to the Blockstack eco-system.

The main goals in the current context are;

* getting to grips with clarity and stacks
* think about core data structures needed for building a SaaS project on the stacks blockchain.

## Testing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:radicleart/clarity-hackathon-level0.git

npm install

npm run projects
```
